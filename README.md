## Getting Started

Hello! I’m Soumil Nitin Shah, a Software and Hardware Developer based in New York City. I have completed by Bachelor in Electronic Engineering and my Double master’s in Computer and Electrical Engineering. I Develop Python Based Cross Platform Desktop Application , Webpages , Software, REST API, Database and much more I have more than 2 Years of Experience in Python

In This Blog I will Introduce a Efficient Architecture to Upload IoT Sensor Data on AWS IoT Core. Well this Architecture uses Facade Design Pattern and Singleton Design Pattern and to Make it more efficient I have used Slots in Python.

The _ represent its a private and cannot be accessed from outside the class. slots makes sure that attributes cannot be added at run time and saves memory. Further I am working adding Queue Data Structure so all the Sensor Object can be Queued and one by one those values can be retrieved and uploaded on cloud. This is initial version I am still working on it to improve it :D
